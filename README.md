## About This Project üìñ

Originally created to meet a tight physics project deadline, this web application evolved into something I genuinely enjoyed building. It calculates fundamental quantum physics equations with detailed step-by-step solutions and explanations.

What started as a 1 year physics project requirement became a fascinating journey into both quantum physics and web development!

## Features ‚ú®

- **Five Quantum Calculators**:
  - Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle
  - Schr√∂dinger Equation
  - Wave Function (Particle in a Box)
  - Particle in a Box Energy Levels
  - Quantum Harmonic Oscillator

- **Detailed Calculations**:
  - Shows complete step-by-step working
  - Provides physical interpretations
  - Includes relevant constants and conversions

- **Interactive UI**:
  - Quantum-themed floating particle animations
  - Responsive design works on all devices
  - Constants reference sidebar
